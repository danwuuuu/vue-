To conclude the requirement of this project is showing information efficiently and use the advanced framework VUE. This system can be considered as a web App because it can be accessed by using both PC and mobile device. This system will be applied in the department of product research development and innovation center to illustrate the products information in Neusoft. RD management system will be used only by the employees of Neusoft and it will show limited information based on the different level of users, for example the heading manager can access most products’ details but normal developers will not be able to see some highly secret files. 

RD management system has really clear construction it has 6 modules which are product information, product manager management, product version management etc. All of those modules have children branches to show the reference in detail. User can also create, edit, delete and search the wanted information in all the modules. I am also responsible to talk with the back developer about how can the data base fits the front work best. It is common to see that one table will need to call data from other 5 table in database therefore it has a really great cascade connection

In terms of its UI, RD management system used white, blue and gray as the main color to bring a sense of efficiency to users. VUE also brings an advantages of responsive mode which means user can drag the browser’s window and the content of web page will fit well.
